  # Adds 1 to a binary number.

  # Steps:
  # scan to the rightmost digit
  # then carry the 1

  # Exercises:

  # • Modify the machine to always halt on the leftmost digit
  #   (regardless of the number's length).
  #   Hint: add a state between carry and done.

  # • Make a machine that adds 2 instead of 1.
  #   Hint: 2 is '10' in binary, so the last digit is unaffected.
  #   Alternative hint: chain together two copies of the machine from
  #   the first exercise (renaming the states of the second copy).

  # • Make a machine to subtract 1.
  #   To simplify things, assume the input is always greater than 0.
