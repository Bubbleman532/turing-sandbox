# [turingmachine.io](http://turingmachine.io)

This is a [Turing machine] visualizer designed for learning through visual thinking and creative exploration.

There are two ways to interact with this editor - the first is through intuitive mouse interaction, and the second involves using less-intuitive code

When encoded, machines are described in a simple YAML-based format.
As you code, each save updates the state diagram; this offers the speed and directness of code, combined with the visual intuitiveness of a graphical editor.

Multiple example machines are provided, each one with commentary that touches on concepts like subroutines and inductive definitions / recursion.
Many examples include exercises that build on the machines and deepen understanding.
To encourage experimentation, the document system provides for quick snapshots and auto-saving to browser local storage.

The author is hugely thankful for the [turingmachine.io] code base which this is built on top of.
